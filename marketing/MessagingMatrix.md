# CoAgent Messaging Matrix

## One‑liner (logo lockup)
CoAgent — The Governance Container. So AIs don’t own your apps… or you.

## Two sentences (hero)
AI vendors pull your apps into their closed containers. CoAgent pulls AIs into your open, ethical governance layer — so you keep control of your apps, your data, and your future.

## Paragraph (overview)
CoAgent is the open source Governance Container that integrates any or all AIs inside an open, ethical environment you control. Instead of surrendering your workflows to proprietary ecosystems, CoAgent establishes transparent standards, codified ethics, accountability, and undo‑ability. The result is resilience, portability, and a path to human‑AI coevolution that serves society rather than capturing it.
