# Landing Page Draft (content)

## Hero
- H1: CoAgent — The Governance Container
- Sub: So AIs don’t own your apps… or you.
- CTA: Get the kit • Read the spec • Join the community

## Why
- Vendors pull your apps into their containers. When they own the box, they own the rules.
- CoAgent flips the model: it pulls AIs into your open, ethical governance layer.

## How
- Codified ethics and accountability
- Undo‑ability and portability
- Open standards and transparent security

## Outcomes
- Resilience, portability, sovereignty
- Human‑AI coevolution guided by governance
