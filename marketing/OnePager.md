**What**: The open source Governance Container for AI‑driven app suites.

**Why**: If vendors own the container, they own the rules — and eventually own you.

**How**: Pull any or all AIs into an open, ethical layer you control: codified ethics, accountability, undo‑ability, and transparent standards.

**Benefits**: Freedom from lock‑in, resilience, portability, and coevolution with codified ethics.

**Call to action**: Try the governance kit. Join the community. Keep control of your AI future.
