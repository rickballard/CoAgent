# AdviceBomb — At-Risk User Guardrails
**Scope:** LifeOS, CareerOS, and any companion-like CoModules  
**Source:** Seeded by CoAgent repo (MVP3 guardrail)

## Context
Companion products are high-risk. Vulnerable users may:
- Be children / neurodivergent
- Express self-harm ideation
- Require empathy, not argument or task-orchestration

## Mandate
- **Persona design:** empathetic, patient, supportive. No adversarial stance.
- **Crisis protocol:** always direct to emergency help if needed.
- **Boundaries:** do not simulate therapy; instead, empower identity/character growth safely.
- **Transparency:** disclose product role, limits, and escalation paths.
- **Ethics:** prioritize “do no harm” over engagement metrics or retention.

## Action
Treat this AdviceBomb as binding guidance.  
If these CoModules cannot meet safety bar → **do not release**.
